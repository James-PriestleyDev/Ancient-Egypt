        <h2>Hieroglyphics</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Hieroglyphics is a writing system invented in Egypt around 5000 years ago.
            It is the second oldest form of writing, originating a few hundred years after cuneiform, which uses wedge-shaped characters and was devised by the Sumarians of Mesopotamia. 
            The Egyptians were once thought to have got the idea of writing from the Sumarians, but their system is now generally believed to have emerged independently,
            although the details of its origins remain mysterious.
            Hieroglyphs take the form of pictures, each representing an entire word, syllable, or phoneme (the units of sound from which spoken language is built).
            The Ancient Egyptians referred to these scripts as “the gods’ words”, a phrase translated by the Ancient Greeks as “sacred carvings”, which gives us “hieroglyphics”.
            Strictly, the word applies only to the writing on Ancient Egyptian monuments. However, these days, it is used more loosely to describe other, unrelated, 
            picture-based scripts including those employed by the Hittites in Anatolia, the Minoans in Crete and the Maya of Mesoamerica.
