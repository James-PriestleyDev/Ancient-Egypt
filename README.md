BUGS

Debugged an issue which I created when adding the google-fonts to my css. 
I had fogotten to add a ';' to the end of the input resulting in all my css styling 
to become ignored by the PC.

Debugged another issue when creating responsiveness with my website. I had issues with white-
space inbetween the header and the main content due to a margin I had placed in to fix a previous issue. Reducing the size of the margin-top removed this issue.

When creating responsivness for tablet size devices I ran into a bug with my index.html page. A white space had been created between the header and the content section. Due to time-constraints I came up with a quick fix of adding a 'margin-top: -10px;' to the intro section and added a comment to the part in the css.
