            <h1>Ancient Egypt</h1>
            <p>Ancient Egypt was the preeminent civilization in the Mediterranean world for almost 30 centuries—from its unification around 3100 B.C. 
                to its conquest by Alexander the Great in 332 B.C. From the great pyramids of the Old Kingdom through the military conquests of the New Kingdom, 
                Egypt’s majesty has long entranced archaeologists and historians and created a vibrant field of study all its own: Egyptology. 
                The main sources of information about ancient Egypt are the many monuments, objects and artifacts that have been recovered from archaeological sites, 
                covered with hieroglyphs that have only recently been deciphered. The picture that emerges is of a culture with few equals in the beauty of its art, 
                the accomplishment of its architecture or the richness of its religious traditions.

        <h1>Pyramids</h1>
        <p>No pyramids are more celebrated than the Great Pyramids of Giza, 
            located on a plateau on the west bank of the Nile River, on the outskirts of modern-day Cairo.
            The oldest and largest of the three pyramids at Giza, known as the Great Pyramid, 
            is the only surviving structure out of the famed Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. 
            It was built for Pharaoh Khufu (Cheops, in Greek), Sneferu’s successor and the second of the eight kings of the fourth dynasty.
            Though Khufu reigned for 23 years (2589-2566 B.C.), relatively little is known of his reign beyond the grandeur of his pyramid. 
            The sides of the pyramid’s base average 755.75 feet (230 meters), and its original height was 481.4 feet (147 meters), making it the largest pyramid in the world. 
            Three small pyramids built for Khufu’s queens are lined up next to the Great Pyramid, and a tomb was found nearby containing the empty sarcophagus of his mother, Queen Hetepheres. 
            Like other pyramids, Khufu’s is surrounded by rows of mastabas, where relatives or officials of the king were buried to accompany and support him in the afterlife.
            The middle pyramid at Giza was built for Khufu’s son Pharaoh Khafre (2558-2532 B.C). The Pyramid of Khafre is the second tallest pyramid at Giza and contains Pharaoh Khafre’s tomb. 
            A unique feature built inside Khafre’s pyramid complex was the Great Sphinx, a guardian statue carved in limestone with the head of a man and the body of a lion. 
            It was the largest statue in the ancient world, measuring 240 feet long and 66 feet high. In the 18th dynasty (c. 1500 B.C.) the Great Sphinx would come to be worshiped itself, as the image of a local form of the god Horus. 
            The southernmost pyramid at Giza was built for Khafre’s son Menkaure (2532-2503 B.C.). It is the shortest of the three pyramids (218 feet) and is a precursor of the smaller pyramids that would be constructed during the fifth and sixth dynasties.

    <!-- Information regarding Hieroglyphics -->
    <section id="egypt-hieroglyphics">
        <h1>Hieroglyphics</h1>
        <p>Hieroglyphics is a writing system invented in Egypt around 5000 years ago.
            It is the second oldest form of writing, originating a few hundred years after cuneiform, which uses wedge-shaped characters and was devised by the Sumarians of Mesopotamia. 
            The Egyptians were once thought to have got the idea of writing from the Sumarians, but their system is now generally believed to have emerged independently,
            although the details of its origins remain mysterious.
            Hieroglyphs take the form of pictures, each representing an entire word, syllable, or phoneme (the units of sound from which spoken language is built).
            The Ancient Egyptians referred to these scripts as “the gods’ words”, a phrase translated by the Ancient Greeks as “sacred carvings”, which gives us “hieroglyphics”.
            Strictly, the word applies only to the writing on Ancient Egyptian monuments. However, these days, it is used more loosely to describe other, unrelated, 
            picture-based scripts including those employed by the Hittites in Anatolia, the Minoans in Crete and the Maya of Mesoamerica.
